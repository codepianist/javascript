## Origins
- Protoviz (2005) 
- D3.js (2011)

## SVG Objects
- XML based vector image
- Came with HTML5 to draw shapes. Can use to render an image
- Raster vs. Vector

| Raster | Vector |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| .jpeg,.gif,.png | .svg |
| Pre-defined resolution | Can scale |
| Don't scales, distorts | It scales, renders accordingly to the resolution |

### Scalable Vector Graphics
- Shape
- + Filter (Adds special effects)
- + Gradients
